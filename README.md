# R_Scripts
This respository contains several examples of R Scripts I have written as part of my research as a PhD student. 

## textanalysis_uspopul.R
This R script pre-processes texts, constructs and applies a dictionary to the corpus,  and merges new dictionary variables with a CSV containing other document variables.

## results_uspopul.R
This R script tests several assumptions of generalized least squares regression using a Poisson distribution. It creates an interaction term, runs several GLM models, and outputs the results into an HTML.

## ANALYSIS LATAM Workers Script.R
This R script creates an interaction term, creates state-level fixed effects, and fits 6 ordered logit regression models.
